It was a global ransomware attack that affected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries. The attack was caused by a vulnerability in the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol, which was exploited by the WannaCry ransomware. The attack was particularly damaging because it was able to spread quickly and easily, and it was able to encrypt files on computers that were not connected to the internet.
